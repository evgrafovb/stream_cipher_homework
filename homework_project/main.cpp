A toy called a flip book was made in the late 19th century.It was a small soft book with pictures.Each picture was drawn in a slightly different way.When you bend this book and release the pages one by one, the images start to move.Strictly speaking, they don’t, but our eyes see it like that anyway.The first real cartoons were made using this trick, too! In 1895 brothers Louis and Auguste Lumière created a cinematograph.It was a camera and a film projector in one device.Using this device, many aspiring film directors started to create their own cartoons. This developed into a full industry by 1910. Many cartoons of that era are forgotten now, but some are still with us.For example, Felix the Cat was created by Otto Messmer in 1919, and he’s still with us, more than a hundred years later.Currently the rights to the character are held by DreamWorks Animation. One of the pioneers in the industry was famous Walt Disney.He was not afraid to experiment to make a cartoon, and his Snow White film was among the firsts to use a multiplane camera.With its help the characters were able to move around the objects, creating an illusion of a 3D world.

Not only the huge tourist flow, but also the development of the country itself and, in particular, the business sphere contributed there.The total length of all roads is at least 399 thousand kilometers.At the same time, there are relatively few highways in the country.They make only about three and a half thousand kilometers.You can travel by car in any region of the country.Don’t forget that the UK has the left - hand traffic.In London, there is a metro or a tube that embraces 12 underground, land and mixed lines.It is worth noting that the lines are often split into separate small branches, so you should always follow the transport route. There are also taxi services in the country.The most expensive vehicles are black cabs.They can be stopped simply on the street.Cars are always upscale, with a clean and comfortable interior.Drivers use a meter.The less expensive taxi should be called on the phone.In this case, you need to clarify the price, since there is no meter in the cabin.Large cities have trams.In London, you can even find two - story trams.However, buses are considered the most popular way of traveling around the city.They run from 4 - 5 am until 1 am.There are some night routes.As a rule, they only cruise around major cities and the most popular destinations.Tickets for public transport can be bought at roadside kiosks, at stops and railway stations, as well as directly from the driver. Locals don’t move between cities by buses; they use trains instead.It will be much more comfortable, although the ticket price for trains is much higher.About 50 years ago, the railway line across the territory of the modern kingdom was in a very poor state.However, the authorities took action, and now the railway network in the UK is one of the best in Europe.The cost of the ticket depends on the class of the train and the length of the way.It is worth noting that you can get even to the most remote villages.Between the regions of the kingdom and between coastal cities, one can travel by means of water transport.In particular, you can use ferries.Special boats, water taxis, yachts and a variety of sightseeing small ships cruise the Thames. Air transport is also decent in the UK.The country has a lot of domestic and international airports, so moving between the most remote points of the state will be quick and comfortable.In addition, the cost of air tickets is quite acceptable.It is possible to move around the city by bicycles.Authorities zealously support this trend, so they constantly expand the network of bicycle lanes.You can rent a two - wheeled vehicle in any town.This is especially true in larger cities, where the ancient streets are very narrow, and the traffic jams can be as long as several kilometers.You can also rent a car, but only with an international driver's license. Such an option will cost you at least $60 per day. Main airports and avia transportation. The air transport network in Great Britain is simply superb.In total, about 450 airports operate in the country.Some of them are used not only for passenger transportation but also for freight.The main airports serve domestic and international flights.Heathrow Airport is the largest air harbor in the country.It is located twenty kilometers from London.It has no equal on the territory of the kingdom.Heathrow holds a decent 4th place in the world.There are five terminals at the airport.Everything there is arranged for the comfortable rest of passengers, including bank offices, cafes and restaurants, various shops, lounges, business centers and baby care rooms.You can get to the city by bus or by train.You can also book a transfer and a taxi in advance, or rent a car. Gatwick Airport is on a second place in the country.Although, it is the busiest airport in the world by its capacity.It has two terminals, between which a line of underground trains lies.An infrastructure of the air harbor is nice.Here, you can find souvenir shops and boutiques, nurseries and meeting rooms, restaurants and cafes. It should be noted that hotels are located right on the territory. This airport is situated 46 kilometers from London. On the opposite side, at the same distance from the capital, there is Stansted Airport. It is famous for its unusual architecture and high-quality service. Manchester Airport is located near the city of the same name. Its scale is not very impressive if compared to the first three air harbors. Still, the quality of service is also great. There are a railway station and a bus station on the territory of the airport. Scottish Edinburgh Airport is just 12 kilometers from the city of the same name. This harbor has recently become international. This direction is very popular today. Gibraltar Airport serves not only civilian but military forces.

The traffic is left-handed, and most tourists are simply not accustomed to this. It can be a problem to drive in the largest tourist cities by car because all the ancient streets are very narrow. That is especially true for London. Nevertheless, you can rent a car in every airport or in a large city. A bicycle can be an option. Almost all the cities of the country have branched bike lanes. Therefore, it will be possible not only to get to the desired destination quickly and inexpensively but also to admire the surrounding nature. The most popular public transport in the country is a bus.Inside the city, buses run in different directions every 15 - 20 minutes.There are lines working from 4 am to 1 am.There are night buses on the most popular routes.On holidays, the amount of transport is significantly reduced.You can buy bus tickets at roadside kiosks, at bus stops or at train stations and directly from the driver.You can buy a one - time ticket or a travel card.In the second case, you can save a little.Long - distance buses, as a rule, depart from bus stations every hour.Much attention is paid to the comfort.Some companies offer their passengers drinks and light snacks. Oxford Two-story red buses are the feature of the UK. However, few people have heard about red double-decker trams. Although they are quite common in London. Such mean pf transport appeared in the capital 50 years ago. Later it disappeared, and only a few years ago local authorities returned such transport to the city. It is worth noting that you can buy a travel card, which allows traveling by bus and by tram. Also, the metro is very popular in the capital. This one is among the oldest in the world.

Please note that hitch-hiking is common in the UK. This type of transportation is safe and inexpensive. The UK has a very long railway network. That’s one of the best in Europe. The most remote regions of the country can be reached by means of such transport. In order to save a little, it is worth buying tickets one or two weeks in advance. You can also get a reusable ticket. The speed of most of the trains in England reaches two hundred kilometers per hour. The cars are clean and comfortable. Trains run according to the schedule.

To save time, many tourists travel between the most famous cities of the kingdom by air. There are about 450 air harbors in the country. Domestic flights are available at almost every airport. You can get there by buses, trains, transfers or by taxi. Since the United Kingdom is an island state, there is a well-developed sea transport.

They really know how to hide emotions and demonstrate an equal attitude to everything that is happening. Locals are incredibly punctual and polite; they try to avoid contentious issues and conflicts. The English have an incredible self-control. It is almost impossible to get them out of their minds. They are taught from their childhood how to manage all possible difficulties. Nevertheless, these people are characterized by the snobbery and vanity. Englishmen rarely use denial or assertion. Most often they answer 'I think' or 'maybe'. They listen attentively without interrupting, but even a smile can hardly mean that an interlocutor agrees. The concept of English humor is widely known in the world. Despite their emotional stinginess, the British like to joke. They make fun of themselves, the royal family, and the church. Their humor is quite specific and is not understood by everyone. The British seek to preserve their identity. They are separated from the rest of Europe not only territorially, but also culturally. This country is the only one in Europe where cars are still moving along the left side of the road. The UK managed to keep its currency and a measure of distance. UK, with all its cultural versatility, has a lot of authentic traditions.The most striking of these is the traditional tea party.A table for tea has to stand near the fireplace, which is the coziest place of the house.It is covered with a snow - white or blue tablecloth.Utensils from one set are used; different cups and saucers are considered bad form.There must be a tea set on the table.It includes a teapot, a jug of boiling water, a milkman, dessert plates, forks and knives, a strainer stand, a sugar bowl with tongs and a wool cover that is put on a jug with boiling water.Toast, butter, eggs, sweet and unsweetened pastries, jams, and cookies are served too." };
